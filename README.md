# AI Onboarding Automation Architecture

This project presents the design and prototype scaffold for an AI powered onboarding automation system built for enterprise environments. The solution is designed to streamline the end to end new hire onboarding journey by combining workflow automation, AI assisted decisioning, document handling, task orchestration, and personalized onboarding support.

The goal of this assessment is to demonstrate practical thinking across workflow design, AI integration, prompt architecture, automation tooling, and implementation strategy.

# Project Outcome

The solution defines and prototypes an intelligent onboarding workflow that improves operational speed, consistency, and visibility across the employee onboarding lifecycle.

Key outcomes include

• Automated intake and processing of new hire information and documents  
• AI assisted classification, summarization, and validation of onboarding inputs  
• Automated task routing for account setup, training assignment, and orientation scheduling  
• Personalized onboarding plan generation based on role, department, and location  
• Centralized workflow visibility through an automation scaffold or orchestration flow  
• Reduced manual coordination effort across HR, IT, and hiring managers  

This project demonstrates how AI and automation can be combined to transform onboarding from a fragmented manual process into a structured and scalable operational system.

# Problem Statement

Enterprise onboarding often involves multiple teams, disconnected tools, repetitive manual coordination, and inconsistent employee experiences. HR teams collect documents, IT teams provision access, managers assign resources, and coordinators track milestones across spreadsheets, forms, and email threads.

Without a unified automation layer, onboarding becomes slower, error prone, and difficult to scale.

This solution addresses that challenge by designing an AI driven orchestration workflow that handles intake, task generation, communication, scheduling support, and personalized onboarding guidance.

---

# Solution Overview

The proposed system automates the onboarding workflow from employee intake through milestone follow up.

The automation is designed to support the following onboarding activities

Collect new hire information and documents  
Set up accounts and access requests  
Assign training and compliance modules  
Schedule orientation and intro sessions  
Generate personalized onboarding plans  
Track progress and gather feedback  

AI is used where it creates operational leverage, especially in information extraction, workflow decision support, summarization, personalization, and communication scaffolding.

# Phase 1 Outcome  
## AI Powered Automation Solution Design

The first part of this project focuses on designing an AI driven onboarding automation architecture.

The designed workflow includes

### Intake and data capture
New hire information is submitted through a form, HR system, or onboarding portal. Documents such as identification, signed agreements, and policy acknowledgements are uploaded at this stage.

### AI based data extraction and validation
AI extracts relevant fields from submitted documents, identifies missing information, normalizes inconsistent inputs, and flags records that require manual review.

### Employee profile enrichment
The workflow combines submitted data with role, department, office location, employment type, and manager information to generate a structured onboarding profile.

### Task generation and routing
Based on the onboarding profile, the system automatically creates tasks for HR, IT, compliance, and the hiring manager. These may include account provisioning, laptop setup, access requests, training assignment, and orientation planning.

### Personalized onboarding plan creation
AI generates a role specific onboarding plan containing welcome guidance, required resources, first week priorities, key contacts, and recommended training paths.

### Communication support
AI drafts welcome emails, manager handoff notes, check in prompts, and milestone reminders to improve onboarding consistency.

### Feedback and milestone monitoring
The workflow triggers milestone check ins at defined intervals and gathers new hire feedback for operational review.

---

# Where AI Is Used

AI is intentionally applied to high value tasks within the workflow.

### Document understanding
AI extracts structured information from uploaded onboarding documents and reduces manual review effort.

### Input normalization
AI standardizes free text responses, resolves formatting inconsistencies, and improves data quality before records move downstream.

### Decision support
AI helps determine onboarding requirements based on role, department, geography, or employment type.

### Personalization
AI generates tailored onboarding plans and communication drafts based on employee context.

### Summarization
AI converts fragmented onboarding data into concise summaries for HR, IT, and managers.

### Workflow acceleration
AI reduces the time spent drafting messages, interpreting intake forms, and translating new hire data into executable onboarding actions.

---

# Prompt Engineering Approach

Prompt design is used to ensure the AI output is structured, consistent, and usable inside automation workflows.

### Example prompt objective
Extract and structure onboarding data from submitted forms and uploaded documents.

### Example prompt pattern
You are an onboarding operations assistant. Extract the following fields from the provided employee intake data and attached documents: full name, personal email, company email if available, job title, department, location, manager name, employment type, start date, required systems access, missing documents, and any issues that require manual HR review. Return the result in valid JSON.

### Additional prompt use cases
Generate a personalized first week onboarding plan  
Draft a welcome email for the new hire  
Create a summary for the hiring manager  
Identify missing compliance items before start date  
Recommend training modules based on role and department  

### Prompt design principles
Structured output format  
Clear role instruction  
Strict field extraction requirements  
Minimal ambiguity in downstream automation  
Fallback handling for missing information

# Data Flow and Integrations

The automation can be implemented using no code orchestration tools such as n8n or Zapier, combined with AI APIs and standard business systems.

Example data flow

New hire form or HRIS submission  
→ automation trigger  
→ AI extraction and validation  
→ structured onboarding record creation  
→ task routing to HR and IT systems  
→ training assignment and calendar support  
→ onboarding plan generation  
→ milestone tracking and feedback collection  

Potential integrations include

Google Forms or Typeform for intake  
Google Sheets, Airtable, or HRIS for structured records  
OpenAI or other LLM APIs for extraction and generation  
Slack or email for notifications  
Google Calendar or Outlook for scheduling  
Notion, Confluence, or internal portals for onboarding resources  
Jira, Trello, or ClickUp for task management  

---

# Phase 2 Outcome  
## Implementation Demo and Prototype Scaffold

The second part of this project focuses on creating a working scaffold or prototype of the proposed automation.

The implementation demo can be built in n8n or Zapier and is designed to show the core orchestration logic.

Prototype capabilities include

### Trigger
A new hire record is submitted through a form or entered into a data table.

### Processing
The workflow collects the record, sends structured fields to an AI node or API, and receives cleaned or enriched outputs.

### Routing
The workflow generates onboarding tasks, sends notifications, and updates the onboarding record with status fields.

### Personalization
The workflow calls an AI step to generate a welcome summary or onboarding plan.

### Output
The processed result is stored in a table, sent to stakeholders, or displayed in the automation tool.

This prototype demonstrates the architecture even if all production integrations are not fully connected.

# Example Prototype Flow

A basic implementation flow could follow this sequence

Form Trigger  
→ Validate new hire record  
→ AI extract and clean fields  
→ Create onboarding record in Airtable or Google Sheets  
→ Generate personalized onboarding checklist  
→ Send HR notification  
→ Send manager summary  
→ Assign follow up tasks  
→ Update onboarding status  

This scaffold proves the core orchestration logic required for a production ready onboarding automation platform.
